# OOP Advanced Concepts

A classic example to demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts is a simple "Library Management System." This project will cover the main OOP concepts such as:

1. **Classes and Objects:** Representing entities like Book, Library, and Member.

2. **Encapsulation:** Using access modifiers to control access to the fields and methods.

3. **Inheritance:** Creating a hierarchy, for example, a generic Item class and specific classes like Book and Magazine inheriting from it.

4. **Polymorphism:** Implementing method overriding and using interfaces for different types of library items.

5. **Abstraction:** Defining abstract classes or interfaces for generic behaviors.
