## Introduction to Java

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for building various applications, including web, mobile, and enterprise solutions. It is known for its portability, performance, and strong community support.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Java, follow these steps to get started:

- [Install Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html): Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine.
- [Set Up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/): Choose an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for a smooth development experience.

## Java Basics

Explore fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control flow structures. 

- [Methods](/Methods/)

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Learn about the core OOP principles in Java, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

- [OOP - Classes & Objects](/OOP/)
- [OOP - Advanced Concepts](/OOPAdvancedConcepts/)

## Abstract Classes and Interfaces
Interfaces and abstract classes are both mechanisms in Java for achieving abstraction and defining contracts, but they have some key differences. Learn more from here,

- [Abstract Classes & Interfaces](/AbstractClassesAndInterfaces/)

## Generics

Generics in Java provide a mechanism to create flexible and type-safe classes and methods by allowing the definition of classes with placeholder types that are specified when the class is instantiated. Learn about generics from here,

- [Generics](/Generics/)

## Exception Handling

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of Java programming to ensure robust and error-tolerant applications. 

- [Checked Exceptions](/Exceptions/src/checked/)
- [Unchecked Exceptions](/Exceptions/src/unchecked/)
- [Assertions](/Exceptions/src/assertions/)

## Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming in Java is a crucial aspect for building scalable and responsive applications.

- [Parallel Streams](/AsynchronousProgramming//src/main/java/org/async/parallelstreams/)
- [Completable Futures](/AsynchronousProgramming/src/main/java/org/async/completablefuture/)

## SOLID Design Principles with Java

SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID principles aim to create more flexible, understandable, and maintainable software by promoting good design practices.

- [Single Responsibility Principle](/SOLID/src/main/java/org/designprinciples/srp/)
- [Open/Closed Principle](/SOLID/src/main/java/org/designprinciples/ocp/)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](/SOLID/src/main/java/org/designprinciples/lsp/)
- [Interface Segregation Principle](/SOLID/src/main/java/org/designprinciples/isp/)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](/SOLID/src/main/java/org/designprinciples/dip/)
